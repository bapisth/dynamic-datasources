# Spring Boot Dynamic DataSources Sample


This is one solution for the Stackoverflow question ["How do I create beans programmatically in Spring Boot?"](http://stackoverflow.com/a/25175780/166062) . There might be other more simple solutions. :)

Running example:
```
$ ./gradlew run
```

Then access the app via a browser (or curl) on http://localhost:8080.
